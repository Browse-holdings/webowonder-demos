Please use this private github repo to share your demo work.

Create a directory under demos. In that directory put all your demo's files.

Make all your references (images, CSS, JavaScript) relative so that this code can be deployed anywhere and your demo will work properly.

Required files

Otherwise, You can lay things out however you want under your directory.

Be sure to git pull occasionally as we will all work together to get the demos ready for launch.
